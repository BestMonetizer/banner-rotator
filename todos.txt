content item randomly chosen and displayed on reload


Questions:

Do we want the content to change only on page re-load, or at a timed interval?

Do we want to assign a fixed location for a content piece to appear (Item X can appear only in box on far left, Item Y can appear only in box in middle, etc.) or do we want content to appear anywhere (Item X can appear in any box -- the far left, the middle, or the right)?
